            <p>For aspiring founders at Stanford who want to learn through side-projects but feel they don’t create enough of them, the Creator’s Community is a tribe that turns working on side-projects into an achievable habit.
                <br><br>
                Unlike going it alone and trying to rely on self-motivation or class projects, the Creator’s Community helps you conceive of and commit to a project for one month, break it down into realisable milestones and celebrate what you learned.

            <h3>Advanced (60 seconds)</h3>
            <p>We run four-week long 'Gap Months'. Stanford students are busy, but many are keen to work towards their goal of becoming a founder. 
                <br><br>
                The Gap Month name elicits the question: if you had an actual gap month, what would you do with this time? 
                <br><br>
                Now go do that during the schooltime!
                <br><br>
                Our creators are sorted into themed houses - 5 people in each house. Housemates meet up once a week over a 'water cooler chat',
                where they share war stories and pleasant surprises encountered in their project.
                <br><br>
                Creators use 'The Coffee Maker' to keep their ambition, milestones and tasks up to date. This helps them to track their project momentum
                - how much time they spent AND what progress they made.

            <p>Every day I work to grow and improve the community. Our first ‘Gap Month’ – 3 themed houses, 15 total future founders – wrapped in November 2020.
                As of December 2020, we are using the feedback to improve the community and interview new aspiring founders for admission to the second Gap Month.
                <br><br>
                To create this format, I conducted needs-finding interviews with tens of Stanford builders alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-dong/">Joshua Dong</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinatakehana/">Marina Takehana</a>.
                <br><br>
                I then lead design thinking-inspired sessions to design our framework for the club. With it, we created the Gap Month system.
