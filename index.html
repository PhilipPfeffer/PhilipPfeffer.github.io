      <h3>The Creator's Community</h3>
      <h4>Product Hub of Stanford Students</h4>
      <p> We are creating Stanford’s go-to place for future founders to make building side-projects into a relentless, achievable habit. 
          I founded & am growing community. 
          Our first ‘Gap Month’ of three themed houses - 15 total future founders - has just wrapped. 
          Currently, we're interviewing the next cohort of aspiring founders (please get in touch!) for admission to the second Gap Month.

        I founded & am growing the community. Our first ‘Gap Month’ – 3 themed houses, 15 total future founders – just wrapped.
        Previously, conducted needs-finding builder interviews and designed our framework for organisation & project building.
        For aspiring founders at Stanford who want to learn through side-projects but feel they don’t create enough of them, the Creator’s Community is a tribe that turns working on side-projects into an achievable habit.
        Unlike going it alone and trying to rely on self-motivation or class projects, the Creator’s Community helps you and a close friend conceive of and commit to a project for one month, break it down into realisable milestones and celebrate what you learned. -->
