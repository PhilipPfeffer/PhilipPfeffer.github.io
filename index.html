            <h3>The Creator's Community</h3>
            <h4>Product Hub of Stanford Students</h4>
            <p> We are creating Stanford’s go-to place for future founders to make building side-projects into a relentless, achievable habit. 
                I founded & am growing community. 
                Our first ‘Gap Month’ of three themed houses - 15 total future founders - has just wrapped. 
                Currently, we're interviewing the next cohort of aspiring founders (please get in touch!) for admission to the second Gap Month.

                I founded & am growing the community. Our first ‘Gap Month’ – 3 themed houses, 15 total future founders – just wrapped.
                Previously, conducted needs-finding builder interviews and designed our framework for organisation & project building.
                For aspiring founders at Stanford who want to learn through side-projects but feel they don’t create enough of them, the Creator’s Community is a tribe that turns working on side-projects into an achievable habit.
                Unlike going it alone and trying to rely on self-motivation or class projects, the Creator’s Community helps you and a close friend conceive of and commit to a project for one month, break it down into realisable milestones and celebrate what you learned. -->

            <h3>Haptic Vest</h3>
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p> Imagine being visually impaired but still able to feel the movement of surrounding crowds and cars on your body. 
            Imagine being a peacekeeper but resting assured that unexpected movements behind you will be transduced into your shirt. 
            Imagine being a twenty year-old playing Pokémon Go and receiving a haptic vibration pointing you towards your next catch. 
            This can be achieved by wearing a 'haptic vest' that uses a camera to capture images, 
            a computer vision model to process them and coin-sized vibration motors that vibrate the shirt to communicate the output.
            </p>
            <h4>Why this project?</h4>
            <p>
            I wanted to learn about AI computer vision on the edge. This application allows me to learn about and experiment with
            AI on hardware while building a full end-to-end project. I have been trying out ideas to make computer vision better
            on edge devices without needing to build a full self-driving car :). Further, I love the idea of an AI driven world,
            like that presented in Daemon and FreedomTM by Daniel Suarez.
