            I love hardware, AI and leading teams to build projects. 
            I bring a process-centric mindset to all my work.
            Currently, I am a Senior at Stanford finishing my EE Bachelor's (Hardware & Software specialisation) in June 2021 and will take an extra quarter to finish my CS Master's  (AI specialisation; currently applying) in December 2021.

            Overarching goal: add massive value to tech exponentials.

                Our first ‘Gap Month’ of three themed houses - 15 total future founders - has just wrapped. 
                <br><br>
                Currently, we're interviewing the next cohort of aspiring founders (please get in touch!) for admission to the second Gap Month.

            <h4>Category: AI, Computer Vision & Edge Hardware</h4>
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p> Imagine being visually impaired but still able to feel the movement of surrounding crowds and cars on your body. 
            Imagine being a peacekeeper but resting assured that unexpected movements behind you will be transduced into your shirt. 
            Imagine being a twenty year-old playing Pokémon Go and receiving a haptic vibration pointing you towards your next catch. 
            This can be achieved by wearing a 'haptic vest' that uses a camera to capture images, 
            a computer vision model to process them and coin-sized vibration motors that vibrate the shirt to communicate the output.
            </p>
            <h4>Why this project?</h4>
            <p>
            I wanted to learn about AI computer vision on the edge. This application allows me to learn about and experiment with
            AI on hardware while building a full end-to-end project. I have been trying out ideas to make computer vision better
            on edge devices without needing to build a full self-driving car. I love the idea of an AI + AR driven world,
            like that presented in Daemon and FreedomTM by Daniel Suarez.
            </p>
            <p>The secret is in the on-chip AI, but here's the prototype circuit I'm using! </p>

                DUTothy is a hardware logic-based version of the popular <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/push/" target="_blank">Ableton Push</a>, an instrument/music synthesiser. 
                <br><br>
                This was built in Stanford's EE 108 - Digital System Design, a notoriously intense class Ryan and I later TA-ed!
                <br><br>
                We implemented three main features:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A looping backbeat that you could design and change on the spot,</li>
                <li>An accelerometer programmed to act like the obscure instrument, the Theremin,</li>
                <li>And a live waveform display to visualise music in the style of <a href="https://youtu.be/bpOSxM0rNPM" target="_blank">this Arctic Monkeys music video</a>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We even added some bonus features!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The ability to change the music to sound like four different instruments (implemented by manipulating the waveforms to contain certain harmonics).</li>
                <li>The accelerometer doubles as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJqbivkm0Ms" target="_blank">Minority Report</a>-esque control, where tilting your hand to the right speeds up your music and left rewinds it for all your editing desires!</li>

                <br><br>
                Genetic algorithms: inspired by mutations in our DNA, this algo randomly chops and changes parameters to become better at solving a problem.
                I coded a genetic algorithm to learn to play Blackjack.

            <h4>Category: Electronics & Games</h4>
            <p>Boggo the Doggo was a Tamagochi-like sprite that lived in a little world defined by an 8x8 grid of LEDs.
                <br><br>
                Boggo was built for Stanford's E40M, but because I already knew electronics, I took it a little too seriously...
                <br><br>
                Everyone in the class had to build these 8x8 grids and had to create their own animations. 
                I thought it would be fun to create a sprite who did not just live and play in your screen, 
                but also, if you physically connected your screen to someone else's, could jump into their screen to explore an expanded world!
                <br><br>
                That way Boggo could jump around everyone in the class's screens! 
                Boggo was implemented in Arduino and the communication between screens used the I2C communication protocol. 
                <br><br>
                Here's a brief I wrote!

            <h3>PHELISIDAD</h3>
            <h4>Category: Operating Systems & Signal Processing</h4>
            <!-- <p> What it is: This program animates a user's progress and accuracy as they play along to a song. It displays 3 measures at a time, and signals to users which note they should play using a metronome above the staff that clicks at every beat. If the note is played correctly, it turns green. If it's played incorrectly, it turns red. The music scrolls every 4 beats so that the user is always playing from the left-most measure on the screen. When they finish the song, they see the percentage of notes they got right. 

                What we did to make it: The three main components of this project were the audio portion, the visual portion, and their synchronization. The major auditory landmarks were getting an ADC configured to receive input from the microphone, running an FFT on that input using KISS_FFT (found online at https://sourceforge.net/projects/kissfft/), and decoding the output of the FFT.* The audio processing here was Phil's specialty, especially once we could interpret FFT data. He did lots and lots of math to optimize the FFT for our needs. Elise handled the graphics - she wrote the song arrays and the functions to draw the display and scroll through the song. Synchronizing these two pieces of the program 

                * We adapted the Makefile of the Kiss_FFT library to our baremetal system, but otherwise configured and used the exact KISS_FFT library that is available online.
