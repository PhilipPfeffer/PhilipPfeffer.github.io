        <p>
            I love hardware, AI and leading teams to build projects. 
            I bring a process-centric mindset to all my work.
            I am currently a Senior at Stanford finishing my EE Bachelor's (Hardware & Software specialisation) in June 2021 and will take an extra quarter to finish my CS coterminal Master's (AI specialisation; currently applying) in December 2021.

<!-- OLD BIO 
    I'm a British-Argentine currently working towards my EE Bachelors at Stanford, looking to eventually pursue a co-term master’s degree in CS with a focus in AI. 
    I grew up doing hobbyist electronics, building a 3D printer, pursuing British A-Level Electronics and founding seven UK robotics teams (for students between ages 11 and 18), amongst other things. 
    At Stanford, I've taken a deeper interest in the overlap between EE and CS, contributing to the Stanford Student Space Initiative and diving into my favourite classes at Stanford - Digital System Design (EE108) and Operating Systems from the Ground Up (CS107E).

            <h4>Product Hub of Stanford Students</h4>
            <p> We are creating Stanford’s go-to place for future founders to make building side-projects into a relentless, achievable habit. 
                I founded and am growing the community. 
                Our first ‘Gap Month’ of three themed houses - 15 total future founders - has just wrapped. 
                Currently, we're interviewing the next cohort of aspiring founders (please get in touch!) for admission to the second Gap Month.

                I founded & am growing the community. Our first ‘Gap Month’ – 3 themed houses, 15 total future founders – just wrapped.
                Previously, conducted needs-finding builder interviews and designed our framework for organisation & project building.
                For aspiring founders at Stanford who want to learn through side-projects but feel they don’t create enough of them, the Creator’s Community is a tribe that turns working on side-projects into an achievable habit.
                Unlike going it alone and trying to rely on self-motivation or class projects, the Creator’s Community helps you and a close friend conceive of and commit to a project for one month, break it down into realisable milestones and celebrate what you learned. -->

            <h3>Haptic Vest (September 2020 - Present)</h3>
            <h4>Category</h4>
            <p>AI on edge hardware</p>
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p> Imagine being visually impaired but still able to feel the movement of surrounding crowds and cars on your body. 
            Imagine being a peacekeeper but resting assured that unexpected movements behind you will be transduced into your shirt. 
            Imagine being a twenty year-old playing Pokémon Go and receiving a haptic vibration pointing you towards your next catch. 
            This can be achieved by wearing a 'haptic vest' that uses a camera to capture images, 
            a computer vision model to process them and coin-sized vibration motors that vibrate the shirt to communicate the output.
            </p>
            <h4>Why this project?</h4>
            <p>
            I wanted to learn about AI computer vision on the edge. This application allows me to learn about and experiment with
            AI on hardware while building a full end-to-end project. I have been trying out ideas to make computer vision better
            on edge devices without needing to build a full self-driving car. I love the idea of an AI + AR driven world,
            like that presented in Daemon and FreedomTM by Daniel Suarez.

            <h3>DUTothy</h3>
            <p>A fellow EE student and I worked together to build up digital systems on an FPGA using Verilog. 
                This culminated in a final project where my teammate and I created a basic hardware logic-based version of the popular <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/push/" target="_blank">Ableton Push</a>, an instrument/music synthesiser. 
                We worked tirelessly to implement three main features were: a looping backbeat that you could design and change on the spot, an accelerometer programmed to act like the obscure instrument known as a Theremin, and a live waveform display to visualise music in the style of <a href="https://youtu.be/bpOSxM0rNPM" target="_blank">this Arctic Monkeys music video</a>. 
                Combined with the ability to change the music to sound like four different instruments by manipulating the waveforms, as well as the accelerometer's double function as a Minority Report-esque control, it was a fulfilling and challenging two-week project.

            <p>CS107E was similarly project-based. 
                I programmed my own operating system on a bare-metal Raspberry Pi in eight weeks and for the final project created a live music interpretation software that would display sheet music, listen to you play music live on a piano, and show you which notes you hit and which you missed. 
                Another tough and fascinating project!
