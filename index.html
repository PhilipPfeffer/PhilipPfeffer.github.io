            <h4>Category: AI, Computer Vision & Edge Hardware</h4>
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p> Imagine being visually impaired but still able to feel the movement of surrounding crowds and cars on your body. 
            Imagine being a peacekeeper but resting assured that unexpected movements behind you will be transduced into your shirt. 
            Imagine being a twenty year-old playing Pokémon Go and receiving a haptic vibration pointing you towards your next catch. 
            This can be achieved by wearing a 'haptic vest' that uses a camera to capture images, 
            a computer vision model to process them and coin-sized vibration motors that vibrate the shirt to communicate the output.
            </p>
            <h4>Why this project?</h4>
            <p>
            I wanted to learn about AI computer vision on the edge. This application allows me to learn about and experiment with
            AI on hardware while building a full end-to-end project. I have been trying out ideas to make computer vision better
            on edge devices without needing to build a full self-driving car. I love the idea of an AI + AR driven world,
            like that presented in Daemon and FreedomTM by Daniel Suarez.
            </p>
            <p>The secret is in the on-chip AI, but here's the prototype circuit I'm using! </p>

                DUTothy is a hardware logic-based version of the popular <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/push/" target="_blank">Ableton Push</a>, an instrument/music synthesiser. 
                <br><br>
                This was built in Stanford's EE 108 - Digital System Design, a notoriously intense class Ryan and <a href="#ee108">I later TA-ed</a>!
                <br><br>
                We implemented three main features:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A looping backbeat that you could design and change on the spot,</li>
                <li>An accelerometer programmed to act like the obscure instrument, the Theremin,</li>

            </ol>
            <p>We even added some bonus features!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The ability to change the music to sound like four different instruments (implemented by manipulating the waveforms to contain certain harmonics).</li>
                <li>The accelerometer doubles as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJqbivkm0Ms" target="_blank">Minority Report</a>-esque control, where tilting your hand to the right speeds up your music and left rewinds it for all your editing desires!</li>

                <br><br>
                Genetic algorithms: inspired by mutations in our DNA, this algo randomly chops and changes parameters to become better at solving a problem.
                I coded a genetic algorithm to learn to play Blackjack.

            <h4>Category: Electronics & Games</h4>
            <p>Boggo the Doggo was a Tamagochi-like sprite that lived in a little world defined by an 8x8 grid of LEDs.
                <br><br>
                Boggo was built for Stanford's E40M, but because I already knew electronics, I took it a little too seriously...
                <br><br>
                Everyone in the class had to build these 8x8 grids and had to create their own animations. 
                I thought it would be fun to create a sprite who did not just live and play in your screen, 
                but also, if you physically connected your screen to someone else's, could jump into their screen to explore an expanded world!
                <br><br>
                That way Boggo could jump around everyone in the class's screens! 
                Boggo was implemented in Arduino and the communication between screens used the I2C communication protocol. 
                <br><br>

It displays 3 measures at a time, and signals to users which note they should play using a metronome above the staff that clicks at every beat. If the note is played correctly, it turns green. If it's played incorrectly, it turns red. The music scrolls every 4 beats so that the user is always playing from the left-most measure on the screen. When they finish the song, they see the percentage of notes they got right. 

                What we did to make it: The three main components of this project were the audio portion, the visual portion, and their synchronization. The major auditory landmarks were getting an ADC configured to receive input from the microphone, running an FFT on that input using KISS_FFT (found online at https://sourceforge.net/projects/kissfft/), and decoding the output of the FFT.* The audio processing here was Phil's specialty, especially once we could interpret FFT data. He did lots and lots of math to optimize the FFT for our needs. Elise handled the graphics - she wrote the song arrays and the functions to draw the display and scroll through the song. Synchronizing these two pieces of the program 

                * We adapted the Makefile of the Kiss_FFT library to our baremetal system, but otherwise configured and used the exact KISS_FFT library that is available online.

            <h4>Stanford Electrical Engineering (Teaching): 3 months, 2019</h4>
            <p>
                I TA-ed for this notoriously difficult class at Stanford. 
                Check out <a href="#dutothy">the project</a> I did as a student in the class!
                <br><br>
                Every week I lead one interactive lecture, teaching coursework and leading students through questions.
                I also held regular office hours where I helped students to build and debug their projects and homeworks. 
                In EE108, homeworks are one part significant Verilog implementations and another part theory,
                so there's plenty of debugging to do. Finally, I wrote midterm and final exam questions, 
                and graded every type of coursework the students submitted.
                <br><br>
                Regarded as one of the hardest core classes, all Stanford EE majors are required to take it,
                it's definitely an unforgettable experience!

            <h4>Capella Space (Space/Satellites): 4 months, 2019</h4>
            <p>
                I worked on <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/" target="_blank">Capella's</a> second satellite, Sequoia, which was recently documented as
                the <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/capella-unveils-worlds-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery/" target="_blank">World’s Highest Resolution Commercial SAR Imagery"</a>.
                <br><br>    
                At Capella, I assembled the company's most complete spaceflight control systems testbench to-date.
                <br><br>    
                I also redeveloped the whole company's documentation for speed & reliability, no mean feat for a highly regulated
                industry and fast growing company.
                <br><br>    
                Finally, I did EE work, conducting bring-up on PCBs, and building & correcting wire harnesses. 
                In fact, I became so well known for my harnessing work, I took on the name Omnetics Man, along with my trusty side-kick, who was based on one of my coworker's dogs: see fan art by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoe-x-y-t/" target="_blank">Zoe Tan</a> below.
                Here's an excerpt from my final presentation:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                As Omnetics Man, I gained powers less useful for crime fighting, such as the ability to name the Omnetics abbreviated connector name for any connector you could ever want. From your A28000s to your A99100s. But this transformation gave me some useful powers too. My internship became a crossover movie where I teamed up with the great hero Vu Le Vu Coucher Avec Moi. He and I built more custom testbed harnesses than the number of scooters in this city.

                So, as only the fifth person around the table in King's Cross, I worked on many of this start-up's needs.
                <br><br>
                I learned <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/" target="_blank">Solidity</a>, the main Etheruem language for implementing smart contracts, to design a <strong>new crypto-asset</strong> and a <strong>decentralized exchange</strong> to trade these assets in a trust-less and confidential way.
                <br><br>
                I also helped the company to build their consumer-facing product by creating back- and front-end features, using AWS & Google Cloud Services and React.js & Redux.js.

                As a 16 year-old and the fifth person working at the start-up, I never expected to find such an incredibly talented and supporting group of people.
                At <a href="https://www.vavehealth.com/" target="_blank">Vave</a>, we were building a handheld, pocket-sized, wireless ultrasound device. 
                And so it wouldn't be too easy, it was to be much cheaper than competitors.
                <br><br>
                While there I taught myself C to develop sensor data collection & interpretation software the medical device.
                I learned all about I2C (which later came in handy to build <a href="#boggo">Boggo the Doggo</a>),
                medical devices, and extrapolating position from a 9-axis IMU.
                <br><br>
                I also helped the start-up conduct competitive analysis for their board meetings.
